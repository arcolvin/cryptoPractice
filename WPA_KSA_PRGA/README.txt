This will guide you in how each of these scripts were intended to be used.

All of these scripts are based on the ARCFOUR encryption method commonly used with WEP Wi-Fi encryption standard.

ksa.py and prga.py are simple demos of what expected output might be for the Key Scheduling Algorithm and the Pseudo Random Generation Algorithm.

KSA.py will produce a longer key from a relatively short initial key.

pgra.py will demo the keystream that is generated by a given initial small key. As a result it needs to not only do the PGRA algorithm but also produce the results of the KSA algorithm. Using the same key in both of these applications will show each step in the generation process broken out.

SBoxFinder.py and FMS_proof.py are used to show the 5% success rate of a given set of targeted IVs, namely (3,255,x). Success is defined by finding a value for x such that the values in the 0th, 1st and 3rd index positions of the S array do not change after the 3rd iteration of the KSA.
